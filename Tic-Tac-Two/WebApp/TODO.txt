Console UI:
-Numbers above 10 sdvigajutsa from the place

game name and change it in db. If not just delete game from db
- Password
- Options (save game and exit, show current password/change password?)

- Instead "new", "loadconfig", etc make ENum


Web Options:
- add gameMode option to change from PlayeVsPlayer to AivsAi
- save game and exit
- show current password
- change password

AI:
- Can't place piece when AI move. Give Error. Or maybe if you try to put piece, then AI makes random move
- Mb add move grid func? Have all movement directions in list, like [D, L, DL,...] and AI randomly makes
a move or moves grid. 
- When choosing custom game and load config should be same function of choosing AivsAI and etc.
- Maybe add gameMode to db? So when it loads game with ai for example, it will continue with ai


PASSWORD:
- Player1 - always X, Player2 - always O.
- When NextMoveBy = X, then 0 can't make move and he has refresh button which makes post requsest, which loads onGet again
- Need to make func in GameRepDB to get a password.
- Make button Multiplayer next to AIvsAI and etc. When Singleplayer then goes to regular PlayGameWeb. If multiplayer
goes to PlayGameWebPlayer1 and person who connects trough password goes to PlayGameWebPlayer2.
- Need to make func, where you get GameId trough password
